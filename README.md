Welcome to my SQL Data Analysis project in Otto's diner Customer Behaviour data.!

Throughout this project, I've demonstrated my excellend command in SQL, employing various functions and codes to extract valuable insights from the dataset. 

I utilized aggregation functions like SUM and COUNT to calculate the total amount spent by each customer and determine the number of days each customer visited the restaurant. Window functions, such as ROW_NUMBER(), played a crucial role in ranking items based on popularity for each customer. 

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) were strategically used for improved readability, notably in finding the first item purchased by each customer. The project showcases my proficiency in handling conditional statements, where I applied CASE WHEN to calculate points earned and incorporated date range conditions for specific scenarios. 

The data exploration encompasses use cases like identifying the most purchased item, the most popular item for each customer, and analyzing customer behavior before and after joining a membership program. These analyses provide actionable insights for business strategies, inventory management, and customer engagement. 

My adept use of SQL functions, coupled with meticulous data manipulations, underscores my skills in performing advanced SQL queriesâ€”a valuable asset for any company seeking a data-savvy professional.
