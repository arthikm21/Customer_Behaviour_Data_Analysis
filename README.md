Welcome to my SQL Data Analysis project in Otto's diner Customer Behaviour data.!

Throughout this project, I've demonstrated my excellend command in SQL, employing various functions and codes to extract valuable insights from the dataset. 

In the SQL queries provided for the project, I have indeed employed a variety of SQL functions and constructs beyond SUM, COUNT, ROW_NUMBER(), and CASE WHEN. Here's a summary of some additional constructs used in the queries:

Window Functions: Besides ROW_NUMBER(), I have utilized the PARTITION BY clause in window functions, as seen in the query calculating the popularity rank of each item for each customer.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): I have leveraged CTEs to create temporary result sets for more complex queries, enhancing code organization and readability.

Joins: I have used multiple types of joins, such as INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN, to combine data from different tables based on common columns.

Date Functions: There's usage of date-related functions, including comparisons (BETWEEN), date arithmetic (ADDDATE), and filtering based on specific date conditions.

Group By and Aggregation: Extensive use of GROUP BY along with aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT for summarizing data.

Subqueries: In some instances, I have used subqueries to retrieve data that is then utilized in the main query.

This diversity in SQL constructs showcases a well-rounded proficiency in SQL, demonstrating my ability to handle complex data scenarios and perform advanced data analysis in a professional setting.
